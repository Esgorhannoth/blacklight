Git Commit Messages
-------------------

- Stick to GitHub's suggested commit message length

- Try to keep each commit in a working state
- Use `git add -p` to chunk up your changes into logical units if you make several unrelated changes

Code Standards
--------------

- Use `go fmt` (there are plugins for many editors which do this automatically)
- Internal interfaces are lowercase
- blacklight datatypes are uppercase

As well as granting a non-exclusive unlimited license to any patents you hold that you utitlize in your contribution.
