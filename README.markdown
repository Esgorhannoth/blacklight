> `blacklight` is a general-pupose **multithreading** concatenative stack-based programming language
with first-class **queues** and **objects** with delegation.

Program state is stored in a simple set of stacks.

Code reuse through vectors of operations and object slots.


Features
--------

blacklight is awesome, here's a few reasons why:

- easy to use builtin parallelism through native multithreading
- data structures are threadsafe by default
- native queue type for inter-thread communication
- stack-oriented programming
- concatenative programming
- objects with delegation 
- great for MapReducing, ETLing, and general data processing


Documentation
-------------

- The [blacklight Wiki](https://github.com/acook/blacklight/wiki) has documentation and links.
- The [examples directory](https://github.com/acook/blacklight/tree/master/examples) contains several demonstration scripts to get you started.
