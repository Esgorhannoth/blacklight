blacklight
==========

In blacklight you can have as many pieces of data as you want up to your memory limit, however, there are no variables in blacklight. Likewise, your functions do not take arguments. Don’t panic.

You don’t need variables or function arguments because you have a stack.

Actually, you have a stack of stacks. A meta-stack of stacks, in fact. And you can put stacks on those stacks if you really want to. But usually I put queues on stacks. And prototypes on stacks. Or stacks in prototypes. Or both.

blacklight is a concatenative stack-based programming language with first-class queues and prototype-style objects.
