> blacklight: the language for people who want to code in it

blacklight is a concatenative stack-based programming language
with first-class queues and prototype-style objects.

blacklight doesn't have "variables",
instead program state is stored in a simple set of stacks.

blacklight doesn't have "lambdas" or function "arguments",
instead you have a vectors of operations on a stack.

blacklight is not an esoteric language,
instead it is readable and powerful.
