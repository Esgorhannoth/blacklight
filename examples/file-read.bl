;; A quick file read example

q-new                 ;; creates a new Q that we'll use as our read-queue
'examples/_text.txt'  ;; this is the filename we'll read from
read                  ;; starts reading from our file in a background thread
swap                  ;; hide the FD and being read-queue to top
q-to-t                ;; blocks until EOF and returns T
print                 ;; prints T to stdout
