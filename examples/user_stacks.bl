;; normal stacks can be created and used for stack-based algorithms
;; this shows that stacks are untyped, you can even put other stacks on them

;; create a new stack
s-new

;; create another stack and push it onto the first one
s-new push
;; push a number onto the stack
99 push

;; say the size of the stack
size say

;; get the top item off the stack and say it
pop say

;; get rid of everything except the top item
tail
;; show that the size is now 1
size say
